From the metabolic pathways chart alone, I predicted that increased sunlight leads to lower cholesterol levels. I also predicted that increased vitamind D suipplmenet levels will lead to increased cholesterol. All of this is based on the metabolic pathways chart. 
Sure enough, there's an observational paper that describes exactly those results! https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5434721/. Furthermore, they talked about how there are lower cholesterol levels associated with people living closer to the equator.
What if we created an AI system that is only trained on these metabolic pathways that can provied medical, dietary, and nutritional recommendations based on preexisting conditions?

we could submit this to the AI hackathon. would be very cool.

I think we should start by doing a very simple example with chemical equilbirium and like two reactants.

Ideally, we'd want the entire kinetics of the whole metabolic pathways.

Anyways, once we are able to represent chemical equilibrium and it is able to make recommendations based on the excess of one species over the other, extend to more reactions that also branch. Make sure to include which enzymes or catalysts are used and create a good representation for it. As for the computational representation, 

It would also be helpful to have the wikipedia descriptions for each of the substances to know what influences they have on the body.

I.e. "Given this description of the chemical {}, tell me if it has any information regarding the usefulness to human health. If there is no benefit, please state "N/A". Thank you!"

After making the program able to provide medical recommendations to alleviate high levels of a certain compound, check if it actually works by doing tests in a bio lab.

Write a proposal as well describing the work, the importance, and how a lab could benefit. Ideally, I say don't publish until you do it.

If you can also somehow model the human biome, that would be so insanely cool that we could try the same thing as well.

If this is succesful, at some point we should reach out to Gerard Michal thanking him for the biochemical pathways and that he should continue expanding the poster. Suuuuper helpful even if it takes a warehouse to open it up.

Then, based on the imbalances or compounds the algorithm recommends you to increase, you can do a cross-check with foods that contain higher amounts of those compounds or enough to balance it out. The actual computation might be difficult but yeah.
